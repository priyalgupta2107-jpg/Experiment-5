# Aim of Experiment: Study of Dictionary in Python.
## Algorithm: 
## Q1. Update product price:
1.Start.  
2.Create a product–price dictionary.  
3.Select the product.  
4.Update its price.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Q2. Search student marks:
1.Start.  
2.Create student–marks dictionary.  
3.Input student name.  
4.Search in dictionary.  
5.Display marks and stop.  

## Q3. User login validation:
1.Start.  
2.Create username–password dictionary.  
3.Input login details.  
4.Verify credentials.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Q4.User login validation:
1.Start.  
2.Create username–password dictionary.  
3.Input login details.  
4.Verify credentials.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Q5. Highest marks:
1.Start.  
2.Create marks dictionary.  
3.Find maximum value.  
4.Identify student.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Theory:
A dictionary is a data structure that stores information in key–value pairs, where keys are unique and values can be modified. Dictionary values can be updated by accessing the key and assigning a new value using the assignment operator. Searching in a dictionary is done using the get() method or the in keyword to check whether a key exists. Conditional statements such as if–else are used to control the flow of the program. Built-in functions like max() help in finding the highest value in a dictionary. The input() function is used to accept data from the user, making the program interactive and efficient.
## Conclusion:
Thus, the program effectively demonstrates the use of dictionaries, conditional statements, built-in functions, and user input in Python.   
These concepts help in organizing data, performing updates and searches, and making programs interactive and efficient.
