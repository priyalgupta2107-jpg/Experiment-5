# Aim of Experiment: Study of Dictionary in Python.
## Algorithm: 
## Q1. Update product price:
1.Start.  
2.Create a product–price dictionary.  
3.Select the product.  
4.Update its price.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Q2. Search student marks:
1.Start.  
2.Create student–marks dictionary.  
3.Input student name.  
4.Search in dictionary.  
5.Display marks and stop.  

## Q3.User login validation:
1.Start.  
2.Create username–password dictionary.  
3.Input login details.  
4.Verify credentials.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Q4. Highest marks:
1.Start.  
2.Create marks dictionary.  
3.Find maximum value.  
4.Identify student.  
5.Display result and stop.  

## Theory:
A dictionary is a data structure that stores information in key–value pairs, where keys are unique and values can be modified. Dictionary values can be updated by accessing the key and assigning a new value using the assignment operator. Searching in a dictionary is done using the get() method or the in keyword to check whether a key exists.   
a)The in keyword is used to check whether a key exists in the dictionary.    
b)New elements can be added using methods like update().    
c)Elements can be removed using pop() or the del keyword.   
d)Searching for a key can be done using the get() method.    
e)Dictionaries can be traversed using for loops to access keys, values, or both.   
f)The input() function allows user input, making programs interactive and flexible.   
g)Dictionaries improve efficiency and readability in data handling.   
## Conclusion:
Thus, the program effectively demonstrates the use of dictionaries, conditional statements, built-in functions, and user input in Python.   
These concepts help in organizing data, performing updates and searches, and making programs interactive and efficient.
